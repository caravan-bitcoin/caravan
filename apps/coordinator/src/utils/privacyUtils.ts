/**
 * Analyze a transaction for wallet fingerprinting risks
 *
 * Here's the privacy problem we're solving:
 * When you send Bitcoin, you usually have a "change" output that comes back to you.
 * If that change output uses a different script type than the payment output,
 * it's like leaving a fingerprint - anyone can tell which output is yours!
 *
 * Privacy rules we follow:
 * - Single output: No privacy risk (could be paying someone else entirely)
 * - Multiple outputs with exactly ONE matching your wallet type: BAD for privacy!
 *   (Everyone knows which one is your change)
 * - All outputs same type OR none matching your type: Much better for privacy
 * - Multiple outputs matching your type: Also good (creates confusion about which is change)
 *
 * @param outputs - All the outputs in this transaction
 * @param walletScriptType - The script type(s) your wallet uses
 * @return Analysis of privacy risks
