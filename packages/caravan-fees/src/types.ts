 * format (human-readable format). This includes:
 * - UTXO.txid fields
 * - originalTx parameters in RBF/CPFP functions
 * - Any transaction references in analysis
 *

 * while the package internally handles the conversion to Bitcoin's native little-endian
 * format when constructing raw transactions and PSBTs.
 *
 * **Output Format:**
 * When this package returns fee-bumped PSBTs, the internal TXID references within
 * those PSBTs will be in little-endian format to ensure compatibility with Bitcoin's
 * internal data structures and protocol requirements.
