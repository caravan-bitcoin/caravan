      - Simple Spend (1 input, 2 outputs)
      - UTXO Fragmentation (1 input, more than 2 standard outputs)

    Definition :
      The address type factor evaluates the address type distribution of the wallet transactions. 
      It signifies the privacy health of the wallet based on the address types used.

    Calculation :
      It is calculated as 
        ATF= 1/(same+1)
      where "same" denotes the number of output address types matching the input address type. 
      A higher "same" value results in a lower ATF, indicating reduced privacy due to less variety in address types.
      If all are same or all are different address type then there will be no change in the privacy score.

    Name : UTXO Spread Factor

    Definition :
      The spread factor using standard deviation helps in assessing the dispersion of UTXO values.
      In Bitcoin privacy, spreading UTXOs reduces traceability by making it harder for adversaries
      to link transactions and deduce the ownership and spending patterns of users.

    Calculation :
      The spread factor is calculated by evaluating the standard deviation of UTXO values.
      It is calculated as the standard deviation divided by the sum of the standard deviation with 1.
