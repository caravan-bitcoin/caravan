description: >-
  Caravan is a multi-signature coordinator for Bitcoin. It connects
  directly to your Umbrel Bitcoin node to query UTXOs, estimate fees,
  and broadcast transactions without relying on any third-party servers.

  Caravan makes it easy to create and manage multisig wallets using
  hardware wallets such as Ledger, Trezor, and Coldcard. It supports
  P2SH, P2SH-P2WSH, and P2WSH address types, and works with any
  BIP32-compatible key origin.

  Your keys never leave your hardware devices. Caravan is stateless
  and does not store any private key material.
